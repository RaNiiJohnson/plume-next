# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on establishing a clear and intuitive routing structure for the board management system that supports organization-based access control and seamless navigation between different organizational contexts and their respective boards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with access to multiple organizations, I want to navigate to boards within a specific organization context, so that I can work with boards that belong to that organization without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to `/boards/[orgIdActive]` THEN the system SHALL display all boards belonging to that specific organization
2. WHEN a user is on an organization's board listing page THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which organization context they are in
3. IF a user does not have access to the specified organization THEN the system SHALL redirect them to an unauthorized page or their default organization
4. WHEN a user switches between organizations THEN the system SHALL maintain the current page context (boards listing) within the new organization

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user working within an organization, I want to access specific boards directly via URL, so that I can bookmark and share links to specific boards with my team members.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to `/boards/[orgIdActive]/[boardId]` THEN the system SHALL display the specific board within the organization context
2. WHEN a user accesses a board URL THEN the system SHALL verify they have access to both the organization and the specific board
3. IF a user does not have access to the board THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and redirect to the organization's board listing
4. WHEN a board URL is shared THEN the system SHALL maintain the organization context for authorized users

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clear navigation hierarchy from the main boards page to organization-specific boards to individual boards, so that I can easily understand where I am and navigate back to previous levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on `/boards` THEN the system SHALL display all organizations they have access to with their respective boards
2. WHEN a user navigates from `/boards` to `/boards/[orgIdActive]` THEN the system SHALL provide a clear breadcrumb or back navigation
3. WHEN a user navigates from `/boards/[orgIdActive]` to `/boards/[orgIdActive]/[boardId]` THEN the system SHALL maintain navigation context
4. WHEN a user uses browser back/forward buttons THEN the system SHALL correctly handle the navigation state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the routing structure to enforce proper access control at each level, so that users can only access organizations and boards they are authorized to view.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to access any route THEN the system SHALL verify their authentication status
2. WHEN a user accesses `/boards/[orgIdActive]` THEN the system SHALL verify their membership in that organization
3. WHEN a user accesses `/boards/[orgIdActive]/[boardId]` THEN the system SHALL verify their access to both the organization and the specific board
4. IF access verification fails at any level THEN the system SHALL redirect to an appropriate error page with clear messaging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the routing structure to be consistent and predictable, so that I can easily add new features and maintain the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing new organization-scoped features THEN the system SHALL follow the established `/boards/[orgIdActive]/...` pattern
2. WHEN adding new board-specific features THEN the system SHALL follow the established `/boards/[orgIdActive]/[boardId]/...` pattern
3. WHEN handling route parameters THEN the system SHALL consistently validate and sanitize organization and board IDs
4. WHEN implementing error handling THEN the system SHALL provide consistent error pages for each route level
